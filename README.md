## Hi, I'm Kagen.
I'm a Software Engineer that loves coding because of there being no bounds on how much you can learn and what you can accomplish. I am always learning more and always building something fun with my skills. I'm fascinated by the challenges involved with building applications to scale and the technologies that help to solve them.
